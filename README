These are the files I use for my Xbox Intermediate XNA talks.

The talk is usually called "Xbox 360 Indie Game Design Using XNA," but it has been known to change based on the needs of the talk, group, conference, etc.

The initial revision of this repository includes the code that was used at CodeMash 2013. I will try to to remember to tag, as necessary, to make sure people can find the state of the demo code that matches a particular event.

This project assumes you have Visual Studio 2010 and Game Studio 4 installed on your system. If you are having problems installing Game Studio 4 on Windows 8, refer to the slide deck for instructions.

Currently, the XACT portion of the code is commented out and the XACT project is removed. For my talks, I use a song for which I do not have a license. This is fine under Educational / Fair Use. However, there is no way I can redistribute the actual audio files. I will try to make a custom song that I can redistribute as soon as possible.
